Here, I have created a small program in python for music lovers.
One can get complete list of songs and even download them all at once.

All you have to do is just give a PUBLIC Spotify Playlist Link.
It means that a playlist link which is publically avaliable at Spotify music platform.
 
While making this little program I got familiar with these libraries:

	spotipy(to use spotify api with)
	yt_dlp
 	or
 	youtube_dl

For developers, while using spotipy library one has to access spotify for developers and create app over there but it is simple as it seems.
So, in order for it to work the Client_ID and Client_Secret is necessary. You'll find it at spotify for developers.
There may be some bugs but it works well for PUBLIC PLAYLIST so if there is any one who wants to contribute or something they are welcome.

It was possible with a collection of help 😁😁😅

These were the helps:

	stackoverflow.com
	github.com
	chat.openai.com
	and many more I can't remember of....🙂
